## Install

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/surajmandalcell/oneplus-ui.git", exact: "1.0.2")
```

Add `OnePlusUI` to your target's dependencies, then `import OnePlusUI`. Run
`swift run OnePlusUIShowcase` to see every component.

## About

OnePlusUI implements
[DESIGN.md v14](https://github.com/surajmandalcell/macpowertoys/blob/main/DESIGN.md): fixed canvases, dynamic colors, two densities,
native controls, and static texture.

Views never restyle a component locally. Add a named variant to this package
when a surface needs different geometry or behavior. Keep approved tool icon
artwork unchanged. Existing `OnePlusTheme`, `OnePlusPanel`, `OnePlusSegments`,
`OnePlusControlButtonStyle`, and `onePlusControl` call sites remain supported.

## Window structure

```swift
import OnePlusUI

Window("Cloud Sync", id: "rclone") {
    OnePlusWindowRoot(canvas: .rclone) {
        OnePlusSidebar(title: "Cloud Sync") {
            OnePlusSidebarSearch(text: $query)
        } navigation: {
            OnePlusNavRow("Transfers", systemImage: "arrow.triangle.2.circlepath",
                          selected: page == "transfers") { page = "transfers" }
        } bottom: {
            OnePlusNavRow("Settings", systemImage: "gearshape") { page = "settings" }
        }
    } content: {
        OnePlusPage {
            OnePlusPageHeader(title: "Transfers")
        } content: {
            OnePlusCard { OnePlusCardHeader("Recent transfers") }
        }
    }
}
.defaultSize(OnePlusWindowCanvas.rclone.size)
.windowResizability(.contentSize)
.windowStyle(.hiddenTitleBar)
```

Set `NSApp.appearance` once for the app. Do not force a color scheme on a tool.
`OnePlusWindowRoot` supplies the window fill, one fixed texture layer, sidebar
line, density, and native chrome. Do not add another root texture.

For an existing root, use `.onePlusFixedCanvas(.logs)`. Applet canvases keep
their fixed width and use the 22 pt title centerline. Color Picker and Text
Extractor keep their content-driven height. All other canvases fix both axes.
Canvas sizes describe the visible window, including the hidden titlebar.
The shared modifier subtracts its measured inset once, including nested roots.
Chrome keeps all three native traffic lights visible and disables zoom and
full screen. It measures the zoom button for the title's 14 pt gap.

Read `@Environment(\.onePlusIsVisible)` before publishing live data to a view.
Fixed canvases supply it automatically. It becomes false when the host window
is occluded, minimized, ordered off screen, or closed, without polling. Apply
`.onePlusLiveUpdates()` to a custom native host that does not use a fixed
canvas. Samplers may keep collecting while their views stop observing.

Page titles start at `OnePlusMetrics.contentTop` (16 pt from the visible
window top). Sidebar content still starts at 54 pt. Header actions center on
the title's first line. `contentGap` is the separate 16 pt body gap; use it
for padding between page regions. Applet titlebars keep their 22 pt centerline.
Applets never use `contentTop`. Their first body element starts `contentGap`
below the 40 pt titlebar or tab strip. Use `OnePlusPage(layout: .applet)` to
get that gap and the 16 pt side gutters. Fixed toolbars and footers also use
`contentGap`, in both applets and workspaces.

## Table and list pages

Use `scrolls: false` when the content already owns scrolling. Header, tabs,
toolbar, and footer stay fixed. The content fills the remaining height.
Slots are optional; the page supplies the gutters and 16 pt content gap.
Fixed bodies end at the density gutter: 24 pt regular, 20 pt compact.
An empty conditional footer keeps that gutter and adds no footer gap.

```swift
OnePlusPage(scrolls: false) {
    OnePlusPageHeader(title: "Processes")
} toolbar: {
    OnePlusSearchField(prompt: "Find a process", text: $query)
} footer: {
    OnePlusStatus("\(rows.count) processes")
} content: {
    Table(rows) {
        TableColumn("Name", value: \.name)
        TableColumn("PID", value: \.pid)
    }
    .onePlusNativeTable()
}
```

Place an inspector beside the table inside `content`; only the table rows
scroll. For settings cards, keep the default `scrolls: true`. Embedded
settings supply only cards and inherit this page's single scroll container.
The page proposes its full overlay viewport width to content. A legacy
scrollbar preference does not reduce the card width or add a side gutter.

Menu panels also own their scrolling. Pass natural-height content to
`OnePlusMenuPanel`; do not wrap it in a screen-height scroll view. The shell
measures each active tab, shrinks for short content, and caps long content at
90 percent of the visible screen. Apply `.onePlusScrollIndicators()` to any
separate row scroll region; it keeps overlay style after native replacement.
Use the optional `toolbar` and `footer` builders for search, forms, and
summaries that must stay fixed. These slots sit outside the capped scroller.
Empty slots reserve no height. Closed panels keep layout mounted and stop live
observation. The shell measures the body synchronously and disables layout
animation. Native hosts use `.onOnePlusMenuHeightChange` to set their content
size in that layout pass. Measure the host before showing it.

Apply `.onePlusFocusPolicy()` at standalone roots. Window chrome, sheets,
popup menus, and menu panels already apply it. Focus paint is enabled only
while Full Keyboard Access or VoiceOver is on. The shared native policy keeps
the window as the opening responder, rejects pointer focus on nontext
controls, and preserves text editing and keyboard operation.

For SwiftUI `Table`, share `OnePlusGridColumn` values between
`.onePlusTableCell(column, position: .first)` and
`.onePlusNativeTable(columns: columns)`. Use `.last` for the final cell;
middle cells use the default position. The model sets alignment, insets,
`textRole`, and optional `textColor`. `headerLabelInset` reserves a glyph
lane before a label. Keep Time at `.mono`; path columns can use `.mono`
with `textColor: OnePlusColor.ink` for primary identity text.

## Component catalog

| API | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `OnePlusColor` | Use a dynamic token, such as `.panel`, `.ink`, `.line`, `.chartSeries`, or `.storageSeries`. |
| `OnePlusTheme` | Use the compatibility namespace; `card` maps to `panel`. |
| `OnePlusMetrics` | Read shared geometry, radii, spacing, and centerline math. |
| `OnePlusWindowCanvas` | Choose one of the 13 tool canvases or construct a fixed preview canvas. |
| `OnePlusDensity` / `.onePlusDensity(_:)` | Set `.regular` or `.compact` at the window or panel root. |
| `OnePlusTextRole` / `.onePlusText(_:)` | Apply one of the 15 type roles with density, color, tracking, and case. |
| `OnePlusMotion.animation(reduceMotion:duration:)` | Returns `nil`; hover, press, selection, and content changes are instant. |
| `OnePlusFixedWindowChrome` | Apply native fixed-window policy; its measured zoom callback is optional. |
| `OnePlusWindowRoot` | Compose `canvas`, `sidebar`, and `content` once per window. |
| `onePlusIsVisible` / `.onePlusLiveUpdates()` | Suspend live observation while hidden; keep the layout tree mounted. |
| `OnePlusFocusPolicy` / `.onePlusFocusPolicy()` | Apply the live accessibility focus policy at a root. |
| `OnePlusWindowTexture` | Draw the fixed root ribbon; normally supplied by the root. |
| `OnePlusTextureAsset` | Access the four cached reference PNGs through `.image`. |
| `.onePlusGrain(opacity:)` | Add static corner grain before clipping to the final card shape. |

| `.onePlusScrollIndicators(axes:)` / `OnePlusOverlayScroller` | Keep full viewport width and thin overlay thumbs on the requested axes. |

Catalogs can use `OnePlusSegmented(iconChoices:selection:accessibilityLabel:)`
for labeled icon segments and `OnePlusButtonStyle.catalogOpen` for 26 pt Open
actions. `OnePlusNavRow(muted:)` dims a label while keeping navigation active.
`OnePlusSidebarSearch(alternateShortcut:)` adds a shortcut beside Command-K.
`OnePlusNavCaption(spacing: .sectionStart)` adds 16 pt before a later section.
`OnePlusTab(countDigits:)` reserves three digits by default for stable counts.
`OnePlusNavBadge(minimumDigits:)` supplies the same slot in other navigation.
`OnePlusButtonStyle(.borderedIcon)` paints the raised square for report actions.
`OnePlusActionMenu` keeps SwiftUI command builders and uses the shared popup.
Its legacy width argument remains valid; the trigger fits its label. Native
submenu commands appear under named section headers in the current popup.

## Add a variant

1. Read the corresponding `DESIGN.md` recipe and check the existing component.
2. Add a named variant in that component's file. Keep its current defaults.
3. Reuse tokens and native behavior. Keep hover, press, and focus geometry fixed.
4. Add the variant and its applicable states to the showcase.
5. Check dark and light appearances, keyboard behavior, and accessibility labels.
6. Add a small test when the variant introduces logic or geometry calculations.

Textures decode once. Chart patterns and title paths are cached. No component
uses an idle animation loop. A temporary task or observer must end when its
owner disappears. Native menus, sheets, text editing, and Full Keyboard Access
keep their platform behavior. Data loading, empty, and error states belong to
the containing card, not every leaf control.

## Build and review

```sh
swift build
swift test
swift run OnePlusUIShowcase
```

The showcase opens a 1240 × 840 window in the background. Its pages cover
tokens, type, controls, data, settings, Task Manager, menu panels, applets, and
feedback. Use the header appearance control to check dark and light. All
sample actions change local state. Quit through the sidebar or window close.
The app does not read MacPowerToys settings, accounts, or credentials.


## Compact and native forms

`OnePlusTabStrip(layout: .applet)` uses the 16 pt applet gutter.
The default workspace gutter stays unchanged.
`OnePlusMenuTab` accepts an optional accessibility identifier for native tests.

Set `environment(\.onePlusControlHeight, OnePlusMetrics.controlHeight)`
to use 28 pt fields, select menus, segmented controls, and regular buttons
inside a compact menu panel. Small buttons remain 24 pt.

Native XIB forms can use these classes with module `OnePlusUI`:

- `OnePlusNativeWindowView`: opaque window body with window tokens.
- `OnePlusNativeCardView`: panel fill, border, and 8 pt radius.
- `OnePlusNativeCaptionLabel`: section caption style.
- `OnePlusNativeSwitchButton`: NSButton state and target/action with a switch.
- `OnePlusNativeStepperField`: editable number and native stepper. The
  existing number formatter supplies its limits. Target/action stays intact.

Call `OnePlusNativeForm.style` after loading a reusable controls nib.
Native titles, localization, accessibility labels, and key loops stay in
the owning application. These variants add no timers or observers.
